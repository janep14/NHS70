      <h2>5th July 1948</h2>
      <p>Health secretary Aneurin Bevan launched the NHS at Park Hospital in Manchester. The central principle: the health service will be available to all and financed entirely from taxation, which means that people pay into it according to their means.</p>

      <p>Polio and diphtheria vaccination introduced. Before this programme, cases of polio could climb as high as 8,000 in epidemic years, with cases of diphtheria as high as 70,000, leading to 5,000 deaths. This programme ensures everyone under the age of 15 is vaccinated and led to an immediate and dramatic reduction in cases of both diseases.</p>

      <p>The Mental Health Act built on the recommendations of the Percy Commission (1954) and repealed the Lunacy and Mental Treatment Acts (1890-1930) and the Mental Deficiency Acts (1913-1938). It made new provision for the treatment and care of people with mental health problems. For the first time it was established that community care should be prioritised and that patients with mental ill health should not be considered any different from other types of sick people.</p>

        <p>The Abortion Act is introduced by the Liberal MP David Steel and is passed on a free vote on October 27 1967, becoming law on April 27 1968. It makes abortion legal up to 28 weeks if carried out by a registered physician and if two other doctors agree that the termination is in the best mental and physical interests of the woman. In 1990, the time limit is lowered to 24 weeks.</p>

        <p>South Africa-born surgeon Donald Ross carries out Britain’s first heart transplant at the National Heart Hospital in Marylebone, London, on May 3 1968. Ross leads a team of 18 doctors and nurses to operate on the unnamed 45-year-old man in the seven-hour procedure. The donor was a 26-year-old labourer called Patrick Ryan. The British operation is the 10th heart transplant to be undertaken in the world since Christiaan Barnard carried out the first in Cape Town, South Africa, in December 1967. The patient dies after 46 days from an associated infection and only six transplants are carried out over the next 10 years for fear of failure.</p>

        <h2>1972</h2>
        <p>Computerised tomography (CT) scanners produce three-dimensional images from a large series of two-dimensional X-rays. The first CT scanner was dreamt up in England in 1967 by Godfrey Newbold Hounsfield, becoming a reality in 1972. His concept will go on to win him a Nobel Prize alongside the American Allan McLeod Cormack, who developed the same idea across the Atlantic. Since then CT scanners have developed enormously, but the principle remains the same.</p>

Dr Patrick Steptoe, a gynaecologist at Oldham General Hospital, and Dr Robert Edwards, a physiologist at Cambridge University, develop a new technique to fertilise an egg outside a woman's body before replacing it in the womb. More than a million children worldwide will go on to be conceived in this way.</p>

          <p>Keyhole surgery is used for the first time in an operation to remove a gallbladder. The technical name for it is laparoscopic surgery, after the instrument that's used to perform the surgery. A thin telescopic rod lit with a fibre-optic cable is connected to a tiny camera, which sends images of the area being operated on to a monitor. The procedure will go on to be one of the most common uses of this kind of surgery. It will also be used for hernia repairs and removal of the colon and the kidney.</p>

This campaign was in line with the original NHS intention to improve health and prevent disease, as well as offer treatment.</p>

        <h2>1988</h2>
        <p>An ambitious project to reduce breast cancer deaths in women over the age of 50 is launched, with breast screening units around the country providing free mammograms. A mammogram works by taking an X-ray of each breast. These X-rays show changes in tissue that might otherwise be undetectable. This means that any abnormalities show up as early as possible, making treatment more effective. Together with improved drug therapies, including tamoxifen and herceptin, screening will help reduce the number of breast cancer deaths by more than 20%, a trend that looks set to continue.</p>

        <p>The NHS Organ Donor Register is launched in October 1994, following a five-year campaign by John and Rosemary Cox from the West Midlands. In 1989 their 24-year-old son Peter died of a brain tumour. He had asked for his organs to be used to help others. The Coxes said there should be a register for people who wish to donate their organs. By 2005 more than 12 million have registered. Organ donation is needed as demand outstrips supply and this register ensures that when a person dies they can be identified as someone who's chosen to donate their organs.</p>

As local organisations, they understood the needs of their community, so they could ensure that organisations providing health and social care services worked effectively.</p>

The Act brought in the most wide-ranging reforms of the NHS since it was founded in 1948. It puts clinicians at the centre of commissioning, frees up providers to innovate, empowers patients, and gives a new focus to public health. The Act covers the following 5 themes:
          <ul>
            <li>strengthening the commissioning of NHS services</li>
            <li>increasing democratic accountability and public voice</li>
            <li>liberating provision of NHS services</li>
            <li>strengthening public health services</li>
            <li>reforming health and care arm's-length bodies.</li>

The programme envisions a radical upgrade in prevention and public health, decisive steps to break down the barriers in how care is provided and moves to hand patients far greater control of their own care.</p>
